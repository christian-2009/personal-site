        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Christian. I'm a full-stack developer currently working at Softwire. While I am
            particularly interested in backend development, I enjoy working across the
            stack and thrive on building end-to-end applications
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm passionate about building interesting and meaningful applications, and I love
            knowing that what I create will be used and enjoyed by others. I'm most familiar
            with TypeScript, React, Kotlin and more recently Java. I'm also working on expanding
            my skills in DevOps to better understand the full software lifecycle.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work, I'm a big gamer, a fan of exploring new places to eat and I love diving
            into fantasy novels. I'm always curious to hear what other people's favourite fantasy books are.
        </p>

            <h3>GitHub PR Comment Tracker - Chrome extension to manage PR comments</h3>

            <p>
                This Chrome extension helps you track and manage comments on your PR (or a PR you are reviewing).
                I was getting frustrated with missing comments on large PRs, so I decided to try
                build a helper to manage comments better. It shows the PR comments that still
                need actioning and allows you to quickly click to them.
